    Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the acceleration of an object
    is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely
    proportional to its mass. This is the foundation of classical mechanics.

  derivation_summary: |
    Newton's laws are empirical observations elevated to axioms:
    1. Law of Inertia: A body at rest stays at rest unless acted upon
    2. F = ma: Force causes acceleration proportional to mass
    3. Action-Reaction: Forces come in equal and opposite pairs
