    The simple harmonic oscillator describes a system where the restoring
    force is proportional to displacement from equilibrium. This is the
    foundational model for oscillatory phenomena in physics, from pendulums
    to molecular vibrations to electromagnetic waves.

    Starting from the Lagrangian L = T - V = ½mẋ² - ½kx²,
    applying the Euler-Lagrange equation yields:
    d/dt(∂L/∂ẋ) - ∂L/∂x = 0
    → mẍ + kx = 0
    → ẍ + (k/m)x = 0
    → ẍ + ω²x = 0, where ω = √(k/m)
