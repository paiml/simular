    Validate that SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Die) provides non-linear
    gains in capacity utilization. Setup reduction enables flexibility gains
    beyond simple time savings.

hypothesis:
  null_hypothesis: |
    H₀: Reducing setup times provides linear gains in capacity utilization.
    90% setup reduction yields ~40% throughput gain (proportional to time saved).
  alternative_hypothesis: |
    H₁: SMED enables non-linear gains through flexibility effects.
    90% setup reduction can yield 100%+ throughput gain.
