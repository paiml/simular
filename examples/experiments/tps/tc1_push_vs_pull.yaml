    Validate CONWIP superiority via Little's Law.
    This is the foundational TPS test case demonstrating that
    WIP-limited (Pull) systems outperform unrestricted (Push) systems.

hypothesis:
  null_hypothesis: |
    H₀: There is no statistically significant difference in Throughput (TH)
    or Cycle Time (CT) between Push and Pull systems when resource capacity
    and average demand are identical.
  alternative_hypothesis: |
    H₁: Pull systems achieve lower cycle time with equivalent throughput.
